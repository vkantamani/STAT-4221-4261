Recent research suggests that the shortcomings of historical and variance-covariance estimation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures can be improved by modeling the conditional volatility of financial time series using Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedastic (GARCH) models.  In particular, GARCH models of return distributions can be used to estimate conditional loss distributions, which can subsequently be used to estimate and forecast risk measures like VaR.  

With the introduction of more sophisticated conditional volatility estimates, GARCH-VaR models have the potential to improve estimation of risk measures due to their ability to account for time-dependent volatility criteria.

This report aims to synthesize literature on prediction of VaR measures in GARCH-VaR models through a case study examining the implementation of VaR forecasting techniques using GARCH-EVT theory.
